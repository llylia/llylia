- 👋 Hi, I’m @llylia
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code to start a new career in project management (also learning about project management.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web development through Odin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on well.. nothing really but I would love to work with people who can help me upskill and who I can help in return. 
- 📫 How to reach me - well, maybe later.
